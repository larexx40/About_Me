        A part four student of computer science and engineering department\n
        Obafemi Awolowo University.\n
        I’m an aspiring software developer (mobile app).\n
        I would like the opportunity to intern at your firm during my 6month Industrial Training period (September 2019 – February 2020).\n
        I believe its the best place to utilize my current software skills and knowledge, and also help me to further develop these skills in a practical and fast-paced environment.\n
        I’m a motivated, dedicated, loyal and ambitious person who can work as a team player under little or no supervision. I always strive to improve myself and I believe I would be able to tackle any challenges I may encounter during this internship.
        I look forward to a positive response from you.\n\n
